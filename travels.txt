One of my most recent favorite travel experiences was near Las Vegas, New Mexico.
There's a place called the Dwan Light Sanctuary near there, it's like a small temple
with massive prisms placed all around that creates these huge bands of light all across the inside.
Very cool, 10/10 recommend visiting.
